# Waypoint-Trajectory-Planning
A waypoint-based mission planner for coverage and inspection tasks. 

This package deals with the path planning problem of an Unmanned aerial vehicle, in order to calculate coverage patterns supporting No-Fly zones/Obstacles and optimal routes in any arbitrary polygon shape. 

Example of Coverage:

## Dependencies

Install all the neccecary dependencies using ```pip3 install <package name>```

#### Required packages:
  * pyproj
  * shapely
  * numpy
  * geopy
  * math
  * requests 
  * json
  * time
  * sys
  * xml.etree.ElementTree 
  
## General use
- For **Coverage task**:
> ~PROJECT_PATH/GeoCordinatesGUI polygon_area obstacle_area flight_direction scanning_distance mission_type speed

- For **Inspection task**:
> ~PROJECT_PATH/GeoCordinatesGUI points_of_interest obstacle_area flight_direction scanning_distance mission_type speed

## Details
- Polygon, obstacle areas and points of interest must follow the original type of .geojson
- Flight direction is in degrees
- Scanning distance is in meters
- Mission type = 1 is for coverage task
- Mission type = 2 is for inspection task
- Speed is in m/s

> Note: Waypoints for coverage and inspection tasks are saved at Coverage_path.geojson and Hotpoint_path.geojson while .gpx format for Geoplaner is also supported.


## How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Open terminal on ~PROJECT_PATH
3. Run 
    -  For coverage e.g. GeoCordinatesGUI map_data.geojson disabled_paths.geojson 0 40 1 3 
    -  For inspection e.g. GeoCordinatesGUI hotspot_data.geojson disabled_paths.geojson 0 5 2 3 

> Note: Visualization of the results can be shown through CoFly GUI at http://localhost:8081/calculated_path
